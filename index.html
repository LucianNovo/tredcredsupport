        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is Tread Cred?</h3>
        <p>Tread Cred is a utility that helps you get credit for your indoor runs. Simply take a photo of your treadmill's dashboard at the end of your workout, and our app extracts the data (time, distance, pace) to create a verified "Virtual Run" activity on your Strava profile.</p>
        <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
        <p>Open the app and connect your Strava account. Snap a clear picture of your treadmill console showing your final stats. We process the image and automatically push the activity to your Strava feed. You can view a history of your successfully uploaded runs directly in the app.</p>
        <h3>Do you keep my photos?</h3>
        <p>No. Your privacy is our priority. The photos you upload are processed instantly to extract the data and are immediately deleted. We never store, share, or analyze your photos for any purpose other than creating your specific workout.</p>
        <h3>Is this app made by Strava?</h3>
        <p>No. Tread Cred is a third-party application compatible with Strava. We use the official Strava API to sync your activities, but we are an independent team not affiliated with Strava, Inc.</p>
        <h3>Why didn't my photo upload correctly?</h3>
        <p>Ensure the photo is well-lit and the numbers on the treadmill console are clearly visible and not blurry. Glare on the screen can sometimes interfere with the reading. Retake the photo and try again!</p>
